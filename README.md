# TODO:
networking
startup screen / win screen / restart button
some powerup ideas:
ball turns into your colour and if it hits your goal you wont lose health (5seconds)
ball splits into 3 and they disappear if they hit goal (but 1 always stays as hard object)
your pallet get longer / shorter (2x powerups)
powerups ideally should start like a ball from middle of screen randomly and be able to disappear if no one catches them in desired time
